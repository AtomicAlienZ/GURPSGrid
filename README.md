GURPSGrid
=========

A pet project: a highly-customizable (I hope) GURPS hex grid constructor with ranges calculation, chess and poetresses

Will use canvas and other cool and good-looking stuff modern and non-"alternatively gifted" browsers (Yes, I'm talking to you, IE).

Alternatively-gifted browsers support will be added when the project is done, I hope.

Planning to do:
- Scalable hex grid with underlying map
- PC, NPC and objects (of different types) placement and relocation
- distance calculations for shooting purposes (will not take into account target speed)
- custom map marks like "you see a langmine hidden here"
- Undo/Redo actions

Dreams:
- Non-passable hexes markings
- Path calculations
